Precautions
---

Use this script at your own risk.
The original author tested it only on XU3 Lite and I only did a quick test after my modifications.

I modified it for XU4 and Lakka and set a minimum fanspeed of 60,
because the fan of the XU4 gives off a high frequency noise at lower speeds.
If you change the fan, feel free to modify the speed values according to your wishes ;)
